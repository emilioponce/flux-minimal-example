## FLUX MINIMAL EXAMPLE

### FLUX super-basic example with React and Gulp

This educational project tries to be a  **starting point** to a project using FLUX application architecture. It defines a scaffolding to quickly set up an skeleton for your application.

It only generates a list with two items, and a button to add new items to this list.

A javascript package manager (npm) was used for working with dependencies, and Gulp was selected as a build system & task manager.
